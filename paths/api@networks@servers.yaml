  summary: Create a Network Server
  description: This endpoint allows creating a Network Server. Only certain types of integrations support creating and deleting network servers, such as VMware. Configuration options vary by type. Note that creating a server will automatically create and associate the corresponding network integration object, but management is done via the network server object.
