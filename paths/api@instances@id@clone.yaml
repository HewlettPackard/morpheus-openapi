  summary: Clone an Instance
  description: |
    One can easily clone an instance and all containers within that instance. The containers are backed up via the backup services and used as a snapshot to produce a clone of the instance. It is possible to clone this app instance into an entirely different availability zone.

    This endpoint also supports all of the same parameters as instance creation, so you can override any configuration options when provisioning the clone.
