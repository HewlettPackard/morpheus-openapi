            The parameters for creating a network router is type dependent. The following lists the common parameters. See get a specific type to list available options for that network router type.
            Note: when creating a router on NSX v3.0+ some BGP configuration settings require BGP to be disabled during initial creation. The BGP feature can be enabled in a subsequent router update API call.
