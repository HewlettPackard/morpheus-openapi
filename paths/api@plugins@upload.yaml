  summary: Upload Plugin
  description: |
    Upload a plugin .jar file to install a new plugin or update an existing plugin to a new version.
    This endpoint parses the plugin file and starts the asynchronous creation and loading of the plugin.
    The plugin record itself won't be created until the reload is complete, so only the `name`, `code` and `version` are returned, not an `id`.
