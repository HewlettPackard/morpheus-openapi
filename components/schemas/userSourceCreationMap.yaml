        This object defines a mapping from the Morpheus role to the identity source role.
        The Morpheus role is identified by passing `mappedRole.id` or `mappedRole.authority` and
        the identity source role must be identified by passing either `sourceRoleFqn` or `sourceRoleName` to match on.
        **NOTE** This replaces the current mappings and must contain the entire set of role mappings you would like to set.
        Anything not defined will be removed.
