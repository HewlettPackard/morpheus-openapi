Our OpenAPI spec is publicly available [here](https://github.com/gomorpheus/morpheus-openapi).  Be sure to select the branch for the version you need.

In order to download and compile the spec, Docker is required to use the instructions in the README.md.  

We recommend using the [Redocly CLI](https://redocly.com/docs/redoc/deployment/cli/) to compile the bundle, although any OpenAPI tool should work.
